# File to cover general design for this project

## Phases
I plan for there to be 3 phases

1. Get basic project stuff in place and get the database up and running. Refresh my memory of PHP and databases.
2. All requirements met, even if not perfectly. Preferably find the password/secret database type but if it doesn't work at first it'll have to do.
3. Improvements for everything there is time for. Better database design, using more of Laravel framework, and so on.
