# File to cover general design for this project

## Phases
I plan for there to be 3 phases

1. Get basic project stuff in place and get the database up and running. Refresh my memory of PHP and databases. Get the CSV file loaded and able to fill the database up
2. All requirements met, even if not perfectly. Preferably find the password/secret database type but if it doesn't work at first it'll have to do.
3. Improvements for everything there is time for. Better database design, using more of Laravel framework, and so on.

## Things to do
1. Find easy to use IDE/editer for PHP. Visual studio code? others? Please no more notepad coding ;)
2. Design work
3. Keep studying Laravel and proper usage
4. Get basic pokemon table up. Add simply debug ways to get stuff into and out of the table


## notes/ramblings
This section may sometimes belong in another file but it's where I'll write about things I know and or am still figuring out.

* Route -> just like irl router. directs what should go to what view/controller etc
* Models -> take control of a single table and data entry, deletion, updating etc
* Controller -> many uses but a route points to this if done properly
* View -> simple a webpage of some sort. Can be html, php, javascript, and so on.
* Service -> similar to a controller but is used to stop controllers from knowing about eloquent and can share lots of generic code with controllers. Requires more files and proper directory management

Repository pattern so PokemonRepository The purpose of this file/class is to abstract how a pokemon is stored in the database from other stuff. 
Let's us change the database representation and no one needs to know above it.
The models themselves will control the tables but this will guide the models to save the pieces of a pokemon. Have a method to return JSON ready array/dictionary/table of a pokemon for controllers to use and so on.
Method to take pokemon information and place it all correctly in the required tables. Again simply an abstraction so we don't have to worry about how the pokemon is actually stored. Many controllers can use it so it should be shared.
Controllers calling other controllers is bad design from what I've read

## Important notes

* php artisan serve --host 0.0.0.0 must be run each time php code changes to have an effect
* Sample addresses
   * http://192.168.10.10:8000/api/pokemon/1, gets to homestead and the call for pokemon with id of 1
